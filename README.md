As a user I can see a 10 x 10 grid so that I can see the gameboard.

As a user when I click on a position, the position changes color so that I can tell that a position has been torpedoed.

As a user I can see how many torpedoes I have used, so that I can keep track of how many I have used.

As a user once a position has been torpedoed, it cannot be torpedoed again so that I don't waste torpedoes.

As user I expect there to be 5 single length ships on the board.

As a user when I click on a position I can see if there was a ship at that location so that I can see if I hit a ship. If there is a ship it counts as a hit.

As a user I have won the game when I have 5 hits on the board, so that I know when the game is won and over.

As a user I have a limit of 25 torpedoes to hit all ships, and when I run out I have lost the game, so that that game is a challenge.

As a user if I lose, I can see where the ships were, so that I know there were actual ships on the board.

Second Epic
As a user I can see how many torpedoes I have left instead of how many I have used.

As a user I don't have ships that touch, so that there is always space between ships.

As a user I can torpedo a 5 block ship, so that the game is diverse.

As a user I can torpedo two 4 block ships, so that the game is diverse.

As a user I can torpedo two 3 block ships,, so that the game is diverse.

As a user I can torpedo two 2 block ships, so that the game is diverse.

As a user I can torpedo one 1 block submarine, so that the game is diverse.

Third Epic
As a user the ships can be oriented vertical or horizontal but not diagonally, so that there is a diverse placement of ships on the board.

As a user I can randomly place the two 4 block ships, one vertical one horizontal, so that there is a diverse placement of 4 block ships on the board.

As a user I can randomly place the 3 block ships, one vertical one horizontal, so that there is a diverse placement of 3 block ships on the board.

As a user I can randomly place the two 2 block ships, one vertical one horizontal, so that there is a diverse placement of 2 block ships on the board.

As a user I can see the status of ships I have sunk/not sunk, so that I have an easier way of knowing how many and which ships I left.
